Queue's are like Stacks in python, only elements you put in will be added to the FRONT of the list instead of the back. This is cool because if you dequeue or enqueue, it will work like the opposite of a line.

Here are the functions within a queue
• Queue() creates a new queue that is empty. It needs no parameters and returns an empty
queue.
• enqueue(item) adds a new item to the rear of the queue. It needs the item and returns
nothing.
• dequeue() removes the front item from the queue. It needs no parameters and returns the
item. The queue is modified.
• is_empty() tests to see whether the queue is empty. It needs no parameters and returns a
boolean value.
• size() returns the number of items in the queue. It needs no parameters and returns an
integer.
